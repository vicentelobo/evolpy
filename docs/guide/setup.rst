Setup
=========

You can install EvolPy using pip:

.. code-block:: console

  pip3 install git+https://github.com/vicentelobo/evolpy@main


If you wish to build from sources, download or clone the repository and type

.. code-block:: console

  python3 setup.py install


If you do not have root privileges, you can install EvolPy for only you (the user!) with this line instead:

.. code-block:: console

  python3 setup.py install --user

Do not forget to install the requirements using the `requirements.txt` file located in the EvolPy root folder:

.. code-block:: console

  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
